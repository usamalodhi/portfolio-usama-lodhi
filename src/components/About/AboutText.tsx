        I'm a graduate of the Boolean Software Developer Academy learning the fundamentals of frontend and backend web
        development. Outside of the academy I've been bolstering my skills in the latest frontend technologies and would
        love to work with you in an exciting Front End Role.

        Prior to web development, I've worked as an analyst in financial services and a PhD researcher, where I've had
        the opportunity to work with both small and large, specialised andcross-functional teams and developed a working
        style that is suited for a fast-paced, self-directed environment
